CODE: Programming Project 02

Getting Started
Create a Python, Java, or C++ project in whatever IDE/platform you'd like. I would normally suggest ReplitLinks to an external site., but the free version only allows 3 projects per account. So unless you're cool with creating a few accounts this semester, install an IDE for your chosen language on your computer or use platforms like Replit, CodeHSLinks to an external site., etc.

Copy the code template to your project (PythonLinks to an external site., JavaLinks to an external site., C++Links to an external site.: for each you can click the "Raw" button in the top right and get just the text to copy/paste).

Note: solutions do not need to be Object-Oriented or organized in a specific way. As long as they are organized and well documented is good enough, the template is meant to guide you and get you straight to coding!

Programming Project
Write a program that takes as input two sets, A and B, and outputs the following:
.

 I want the program to take file input and output to both the console and a file.

Submission Instructions
When you've completed your chosen problem, submit a screenshot of your code. Make sure the screenshot includes ALL of the code and an example of it running. If you're able to link your project, feel free to add that but a screenshot is more than enough!
